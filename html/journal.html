    Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed 
    through some interesting places on the way:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Walla Waklla, WA,</li>
    <li>Magic City, ID,</li>
    <li> Bountiful, UT,</li>
    <li> Last Chane, CO,</li>
    <li>Why, AZ,</li>
    <li>Truth or Conssequences, NM.</li>
  </ol>

    I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of
    road today: 
  </p>
  <blockquote>
     Passing cars,<br>
     When you can't see ,<br>
     May getyou,<br>
     A glimpse,<br>
     Of eternity.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I definitely won't be Passing
    any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
    everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segyay,
    digital camera, and a protein bar Just the essentials. As
    Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
    with one Segway.</q>
